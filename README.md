# Video_to_PowerPoint

Application to capture video presentations running on your computer screen and convert to PowerPoint slides.

## Description

I take a lot of online classes and most of them provide the powerpoint slides to review the material at a later date. Unfortunately, some courses do not provide the slides. Rather than taking screenshots for every new slide that pops up on the video, Video-to-PowerPoint is a application that converts streaming video on your computer screen to powerpoint slides and saves them on your computer.

## Project Status

Currently converting Jupyter notebook to python file

## Python libraries used:

[Pynput](https://github.com/moses-palmer/pynput): Capture screen area using mouse click and release

[Pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow): Capture screenshot of designated screen area

[Python-pptx](https://github.com/scanny/python-pptx): Save screenshots to PowerPoint file.

[Scikit-image](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image): Calculate Mean Squared Error between previously saved screenshot and most recent screenshot.

[Time](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html): Suspends execution of while loop to take a screenshot every 5 seconds.


## Usage

Open Video_to_PowerPoint.ipynb in jupyter notebook. Change PowerPoint file name. 

Python file is a work in progress
